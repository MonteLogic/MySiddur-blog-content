# MoL-blog-project-notes-1

## ...

- We gotta make it more readable for the blog.

- We have an issue with the blog posts taking too long to load.

- I like the folder structure and then there's going to be a category and I guess you can tie up the category with the schema for good results on the blog.

- I think it may be better to just go on the category of the markdown file and the user can organize their folders the way they like.

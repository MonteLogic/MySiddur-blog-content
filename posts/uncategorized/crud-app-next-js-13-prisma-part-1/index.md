The goal is to make a music venue scheduler for large promoters.

This scheduler app will use Next.js 13 with Prisma due to the fact that Prisma offers the best developer experience for an ORM.

There will be two pages, the venue creator and the scheduler.

The server component is going to be simple as it is going to bring the data in from just one Prisma table.

The GitHub repo, [promoter-scheduler](https://github.com/MonteLogic/promoter-scheduler)

Using [app-router playground](https://github.com/vercel/app-playground.git) as the template.

Isolate - [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPR1DZ2/?coliid=I1T6M2M23G0AAV&colid=10H8R8SOT4D61&psc=1&ref\_=list\_c\_wl\_lv\_ov\_lig\_dp\_it](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MPR1DZ2/?coliid=I1T6M2M23G0AAV&colid=10H8R8SOT4D61&psc=1&ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it) , I get the unflavored one as I have a sensitive stomach and prefer to flavor it with my own natural sweetener, which is Peanut Butter powder.

As of writing this, there is not a Cholov Yisrael, Hydrolized Whey Protein Powder product.

Currently, the only Cholov Yisrael products are all concentrates. I doubt there will be a product which will be Isolate soon, as I am under the impression that the vast majority of Jews are NOT lactose intolerant. However, I would also assume that, Ethiopian Jewery are likely to be mainly Lactose Intolerant due to African genetics. I myself am Half-African, Half-European.

## The Tribulus I take is Kosher

I would only recommend taking Testosterone supplements before going to bed as doing this will damper aggression which is a side effect of testosterone supplements.

Another testorone focused product coming is [Male Energy](https://www.nutrisupremevitamins.com/male-energy/) from Nutri-Supreme.

## Cholov Yisreal

This Cholov Yisrael [product](https://www.amazon.com/Qualify-Protein-Chocolate-Flavored-Essential/dp/B0C2DG28WC?crid=1F0WUCHKC943Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.29-RMT5YrGCKCBMIJe_ttb6jdAWJiBN5tAYojOBeXtTXWDnv47O7FvnULtiZdHsfhU6wlD8B6ctzFIti9dZIGgwgFYdTYOG5xoVuL5CDU2AjDnkbyIwy9UvfeKtwu3haq97e2L1ijufHLhabFNabzgTOkg7oIfmZlZEdLgkZ0QXERWO41GffeF0sWmzkFyoTxdiKJomGoPfPeEq3V6yTqv7MIJcQ5dnM7qJuVZyjk1pbUiNo4XFDmi7AAQTpVf-o4cWlsRPwesWLjS5kVXeakhFxm7qCktJolq5QQ6fLTXo.Y-va3XGSVWDEN6mMeHYcf3LGtRaTPDLWGO3e2Ajr8c0&dib_tag=se&keywords=cholov%2Byisroel%2Bwhey%2Bprotein%2Bpowder&qid=1733681005&sprefix=Cholov%2B%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-5&th=1) is from Qualify which has a high certification but doesn't seem to be a Jewish-Centric company.

However, this Cholov Yisreal [product](https://www.amazon.com/Nutri-Supreme-Research-Protein-Vanilla-Yisroel/dp/B00IQU9R0K?crid=1F0WUCHKC943Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.29-RMT5YrGCKCBMIJe_ttb6jdAWJiBN5tAYojOBeXtTXWDnv47O7FvnULtiZdHsfhU6wlD8B6ctzFIti9dZIGgwgFYdTYOG5xoVuL5CDU2AjDnkbyIwy9UvfeKtwu3haq97e2L1ijufHLhabFNabzgTOkg7oIfmZlZEdLgkZ0QXERWO41GffeF0sWmzkFyoTxdiKJomGoPfPeEq3V6yTqv7MIJcQ5dnM7qJuVZyjk1pbUiNo4XFDmi7AAQTpVf-o4cWlsRPwesWLjS5kVXeakhFxm7qCktJolq5QQ6fLTXo.Y-va3XGSVWDEN6mMeHYcf3LGtRaTPDLWGO3e2Ajr8c0&dib_tag=se&keywords=cholov+yisroel+whey+protein+powder&qid=1733681216&sprefix=Cholov+%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-8) is from a Jewish-Centric company but is much more pricey.

I would buy the latter product if it was Hydro or at the very least an Isolate but since I am VERY lactose intolerant, I am buying neither of them for personal consumption.

ToDo: Create a petiton for a Kosher certified Hydrolized whey product are there are currently none on the market.

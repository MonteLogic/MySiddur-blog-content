I learned that SQLite is good--if it's with LibSQL.

Learned that you have to normalize a database especially if you want the structure to scale.

Learned that using third-party products for your app is great because it works and it's just good. I used Clerk for signin and I feel if I were to make my own, even if it worked it wouldn't be as user-friendly and work as well as if I just used Clerk.  
Also, using Vercel's stuff would fall into this category.

Learned that good sleep is paramount for developing code. Coffee, Creatine, Magnesuim, all this stuff helps but nothing compares to a great night sleep (9+ hours)

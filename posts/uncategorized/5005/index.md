title: "Gutenberg to Next.js?"

I envision a workflow within WordPress Gutenberg or if you know next JS you can use it or if you learn Gutenberg well you can transfer it to next GS smoothly. This would be almost as if WordPress Gutenberg chose next JS over create racked up even though next JS wasn't even nearly as popular as credit react app whenever they chose create react app.

if you are interested in developing a workflow like this, please leave a comment. Or contact me at my email listed on this website, or on Threads, @MonteLogic99

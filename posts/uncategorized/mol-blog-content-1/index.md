I want the suite to have a mailing list functionality, and I want for this to be editable by Gutenberg.

Jetpack CRM mailing list

If it's going to be sent by monte@montelogic.com, I'm not exactly sure the rates at which its going to hit someone's inbox vs. their spam folder.

Jetpack CRM there's a lot of extra stuff and it's distracting.

...

We need a way to track users on their buying journey.

Looking at:

CRM:

I really notice a ceiling for php projects, they are only SO big.

I'm not seeing LARGE ambitious projects in php.

...
Sending email via just WordPress is called SMTP.

Wemail is wanting me to make an account.

Look if it's real SMTP, then we don't need a third party.

I would like to use solely php to get it done but I guess SMTP you need a third party.

....

Here's the problem, email marketing has been the same for the past 20 years, why are all of these people pursuing markups? Why is Mailchimp trying so hard to get your money?

That's not how tech should work. Tech should make the things which were happening 20 years ago, happen today with the utmost ease.

...
Need book consultation plugin!

Get:
phillydomnetwork.com

and book consultations with the consultation plugin.

'WooCommerce appointments'

What I want is to have like a page where it's like book a consultation and it's like a survey of questions of what will be discussed.

I would also like for this to be a WooCommerce product.

BOOKINGS FOR WOOCOMMERCE is kind of whack because I would like for it to be a Woo product.

I want to make a booking/consultation site for experts. It would also be dope if there was a cheaper option for asking questions, rather than getting the expert face to face.

For this, I don't even notice a scheduling feature, so I'm guessing after purchase they would be brought to a calender after and shown empty spots to book.

Ideally, it would all be on the same page as far as scheduling:

I swear, I am going to switch away from WordPress as it is because it takes way to long Next.js with SSG is much better due to the fact that it is 100 times faster!

I wonder if you can make themes sort of with the headless thing.

But I stil like Full Site editing. Ideally we can use FSE for creating the look of the page and then have it be compiled out to a SSG.

"eCommerce wordpress headless next.js"

I think I'm going to do what Conor Clyne does as far as paying for the consultation but after it, I'm going to show a link to the Calendar where the person can designate a spot and this is going to be on a different website, maybe Google Calendar or something like this.

I think I'm going to create a Stripe buy button for this.

Why you should write work notes:
"We're looking to build an app and need help from someone who has deep experience with the Facebook Commerce Platform. If you've recently built an app on top of the Facebook Commerce API, we would like to hire you as a consultant for this project. Thank you."

It would be dope if I could edit the post template to add a Call To Action for my PDF.

Added product now, going to focus on cBud, until x date and then focus on 'Questioneer'.

Writing:
:r !date "+%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S %Z"

For this now:

Okay, going to work on cBud until **18:22:59**

Okay, so.....

The issue with the cart appears to be a hosting issue as the cart works just fine on localwp.

So, I'm going to try to update my php version via cPanel.

"cart works when logged in but not when logged out wordpress woocommerce"

My caching was the problem.

I would like to have a pinned posts feature, to pin to the homepage the posts which are the best.

## Search MO99

I would also like mo99 to be queryable from a terminal, so take for instance, I could run mo99 search-posts "Post Name" and then have all a list of the posts and their ids and then I could run a cat command of it to view the whole post.

WordPress has shown us time and time again that it's just too dated and too bulky to offer SaaS product implementation. Even for WooCommerce there is just too much of a headache and I would recommend Shopify over WooCommerce due to the fact that Shopify is just less buggy.

Also, Shopify offers better Node implemention which far surpasses WordPress Gutenberg implementation which is stuck on a Create React App (which has been sunsetted by Facebook) foundation rather than a more modern approach.

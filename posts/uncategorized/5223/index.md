What needs to change in WordPress to make it a 2024 competive stack.

For creating a Web App there are three mainstream options, Next.js, Remix and Svelete kit.

Why isn't WordPress in this discussion?

There's not a straight forward way to do it and if there is it's wp gutenberg blocks which is based off of create React App so it's Dead on Arrival.

We need a project which will pivot it to something like Next.js where it will be compatible in skill set with the Next.js skillset.

If we could replace a lot of Server Side php logic WordPress uses with RSCs I think this will go a long way of fixing the aforementioned issues.

Or rewrite it in go. We want to make it in a way which if you just open it, it'll run just the same way as PHP would run.

I think it would be tough to replace PHP with Golang because thats like tough to get WordPress people to change. So this functionality would be done with RSCs.

I don't think you can replace the stuff with RSCs as all of that stuff you would have to real with version issues and what not.

I mean, what could happen is that you could just make a tech stack which would be for writing WordPress plugins but then you can take it out of the plugin in its own standalone thing.

Currently the plugins are deeply tied with the WordPress ecosystem. There are also hooks in WordPress which would need to be reproduced or brought in if the plugin/app would be able to operate as a standalone thing.

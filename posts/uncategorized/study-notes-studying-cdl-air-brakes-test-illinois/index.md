Grand set:

The spring brakes used on tractors and straight trucks will bring your truck to a stop when the air pressure drops below:  
20 psi.  
Excessive heat caused by using your brakes too often can cause the:  
brakes to fade or fail  
If air pressure does NOT build up to normal within the correct amount of time, then:  
your air pressure may drop to low driving, requiring an emergency stop.  
If your truck has dual air system and one of the systems is low on pressure:  
either the front or rear brakes will not be gully operational.  
In air brakes vehicles, the parking brakes should be used:  
any time the vehicle is parked.  
The braking power of the spring brakes:  
depends on the service brakes being in adjustment.  
The driver must be able to see a warning before air pressure in the service air tanks falls below:  
60 psi.  
The use of air brakes on a long and/or steep downgrade under normal conditions is only supplement to:  
the braking effect of the engine.  
The air compressor governor controls:  
when air is pumped into the air tanks.  
The parking or emergency brake on a heavy vehicle can only be held in position by something that cannot leak away, like:  
spring pressure.  
The brake pedal in an air brake system:  
Controls the air pressure applied to put on the brakes.  
If you must make an emergency stop, brake so you :  
Can steer and your vehicle stays in a straight line.  
A supply pressure gauge tells you how much air is in the:  
air tanks.  
Under normal conditions, in order to engage the parking brakes the driver must first:  
let the air out of the air brake system.  
For air brake systems in good condition, the air compressor should start pumping at about:  
100 psi  
When is it OK to leave your truck without applying the parking brake or chocking the wheels?  
never.  
Under ideal conditions, a truck with air brake going 55 miles per hour would require a stopping distance of:  
more than 300 feet.  
Air braking takes more time than hydraulic braking because:  
air takes more time to flow through the line than fydrauli fluids.  
If you are driving down a steep downgrade and you have reached your "safe" speed f 40 mph, you would apply the service rakes until your speed drops to:  
35 mph.  
A slack adjuster probably needs to be adjusted if it moves more than about:  
1 inch when you pull hard on it  
During normal driving spring brakes are usually held back by:  
air pressure.  
Emergency stab braking is when you:  
brake as hard as you can, release the bakes hen the wheels lock, put on the brakes again when the wheels start rollling  
How should you check that the spring brakes come on when air pressure in the system drops below a certain level?  
park on level ground, chock the wheels, release the parking brake when you have enough air pressure shut the engine off and repeatedly press and release the brake pedal.  
Excessive use of the service brakes results in over-heating, which can lead to:  
Expansion of the brake drums.  
The most important thing to do when a low air pressure warning come on is:  
stop and safely park as soon as possible.  
An air brake system is fully charged at:  
125 psi.  
To check the free play of manual slack adjuster on S-Cam brakes, you should park on:  
level ground, chock the wheels, and turn of the parking brakes.

stop right away and safely park. Continue only after the system is fixed.  
Your vehicle has a dual air brake system. If a low air pressure warning comes on for the secondary system, you should?  
bring the vehicle to a safe stop and continue only when the system is fixed.  
The S-Cam:  
forces the brake shoes against the inside of the brake drum.  
The brake system that applies and releases the brakes when the driver uses the brake pedal is the:  
service brake system.  
The application pressure gauge shows how much air pressure you:  
are applying to the brakes  
Modern air brake systems combine three different systems. They are the service, parking and the:  
emergency brakes.  
The air compressor should stop pumping at about:  
125 psi.  
The safety valve is set to automatically reduce pressure at:  
150 psi.  
If your truck or bus has dual parking control valves, you can use pressure from a separate tank to:  
release the spring emergency/parking brakes to move a short distance.  
If you must make an emergency stop, brake so you:  
can steer and your vehicle stays in a straight line.  
With air brake vehicle, the parking brakes should be used:  
whenever leave the vehicle unattended.  
Emergency controlled braking is when you:  
brake as hard as you can, release the brakes when the wheels lock and put the brakes back on again when the wheels start rolling.

AIR BRAKES - FACT SHEET  
CDL

1. The air loss rate for a straight truck or bus with the engine off and the brakes on should not be more than 3 PSI in one minute.

3. Your brakes are fading when you have to push harder on the brake pedal to control your speed on a downgrade.

5. The supply pressure gauge shows how much pressure is in the air tanks.

7. The brake system that applies and releases the brakes when the driver uses the brake pedal is the service brake system.

9. If your vehicle has an alcohol evaporator, every day during cold weather you should check and fill the alcohol level.

11. You should drain the water from compressed air tanks because water can freeze in cold weather and cause brake failure.

13. To test service brakes, you should brake firmly when moving slowly forward. The brakes are O.K. if you do not notice a delayed  
    stopping action, an unusual feel, or the vehicle “pulls” to one side.

15. On long downhill grades, apply the brakes just enough to feel a slowdown. When your speed has been reduced to  
    approximately five miles per hour below your “safe” speed, release the brakes. When your speed has increased to your  
    safe speed, repeat steps one and two. Repeat this until you have reached the end of the downhill grade.

17. Your truck or bus has a dual air brake system. If a low air pressure warning comes on for only one system, what should you do?  
    Stop right away and safely park. Continue only after the system is fixed.

19. During normal driving, spring brakes are usually held back by air pressure.

21. Total stopping distance for air brakes is longer than that for hydraulic brakes due to brake lag.

23. The most common type of foundation brake found on heavy vehicles is the S-CAM brake system.

25. With air brake vehicles, the parking brake should be used whenever you leave the vehicle unattended.

27. For emergency stab braking, you should press on the brake pedal as hard as you can, release the brakes when the wheels  
    lock, and when the wheels start rolling press the brakes fully again.

29. Parking or emergency brakes on trucks and buses can be held on by spring pressure.

31. The driver must be able to see a low air pressure warning, which comes on when pressure in the air tanks fall below 60  
    PSI.

33. If your vehicle has an alcohol evaporator, it is there to reduce the risk of ice in air brake valves in cold weather.

35. The brake pedal in an air brake system controls the air pressure applied to put on the brakes.

37. If your truck or bus has dual parking control valves, you can use pressure from a separate tank to release the  
    emergency/parking brakes to move a short distance.

39. To check the free play of manual slack adjusters of S-CAM brakes, you should park on level ground, chock the wheels, and  
    release the parking brake.

41. The most important thing to do when a low air pressure warning comes on is stop and safely park as soon as possible.

43. The air compressor governor controls when air is pumped into the air tanks.

45. The braking power of the spring brakes depends on the service brakes being in adjustment.

47. All air brake equipped vehicles have a supply pressure gauge.

49. If you must make an emergency stop, you should brake so you can steer and so your vehicle stays in a straight line.

51. The parking or emergency brake on a heavy vehicle can only be held in position by something that cannot leak away, like spring  
    pressure.

53. A straight truck or bus air brake system should not leak at a rate of more than 2 PSI per minute with the engine off and the brakes  
    released.

55. Your vehicle has a dual air brake system. If a low air pressure warning comes on for the secondary system, you should bring the  
    vehicle to a safe stop and continue only when the system is fixed.

57. Air braking takes more time than hydraulic braking because air takes more time to flow through the lines than hydraulic fluid.

59. Air brake systems combine three different systems. They are the service, parking, and the emergency brake systems.

61. The application pressure gauge shows how much air pressure you are applying to the brakes.

63. If you do not have automatic tank drains, you should drain the oil and water from the air storage tanks at the end of each  
    day of driving.

65. The proper method of braking when going down long and/or steep grades after selecting the proper gear is to brake your speed is about 5 miles per hour below your "safe" speed and then release your brakes.

I try to include images so I can know what I was talking about. Ultimately, I don't slow down and make a video on the thing I'm working on, I usually go back, so images and notes of what's going on is important.

I use MoL Custom blocks and just add the widget to the WordPress post, it'll tell me the time.

If you're not asking the question why at least every 10 lines of documenting the process then to me it's not good work notes. We have to know the reasons why you came to that conclusions or are trying to do the things which you are doing.

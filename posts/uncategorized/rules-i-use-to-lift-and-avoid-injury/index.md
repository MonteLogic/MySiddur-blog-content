- When doing a new lift do it for 6 sessions before ramming it. So do it like high reps low PPE and you should only start ramming once you hit those 6 sessions.

- Do pause reps

- For every 2 normal session do 1 tempo session.

- DON'T do dumbbell jumps, rather, do resisted band jumps with or without dumbbells.

- Ramming on machines is easier for avoiding injuries but don't get carried away.

- Warms up are important but they just reduce the likelihood of injury not eliminate it.

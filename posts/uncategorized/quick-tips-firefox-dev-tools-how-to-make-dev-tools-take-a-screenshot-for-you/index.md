In the console of devtools go in inspect mode find the element you want to screenshot right click on it and press screenshot node. If you would like it to be more narrow or more wide adjust the size of your browser and the screenshot will come out as such. This saves time over screenshotting it mannualy and then trying to figure out the precise corners in GIMP.

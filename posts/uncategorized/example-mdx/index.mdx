# My First MDX Blog Post

This is a paragraph of regular markdown content.

## Code Example

```javascript
// This code block will be syntax-highlighted
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## React Component Example

You can even include React components directly in your MDX:

{/* <InfoBox>
  This is content inside a custom React component!
</InfoBox> */}

## Lists and Tables

MDX supports all standard markdown features like:

* Bulleted lists
* Numbered lists
* **Bold text**
* *Italic text*

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

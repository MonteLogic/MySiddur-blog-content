title: "Study Notes: Getting my CDL B in Illinois"
date: "2023-08-08"
---

I failed this test 4 out of the 5 times I've taken it and the one time I did get it right I wasn't able to get the permit turned to a license due to the fact

This, [here](https://www.ilsos.gov/publications/pdf_publications/dsd_cdl10.pdf) is the study guide but they must've updated the study guide because I haven't seen this one yet.

This [practice test](https://www.dmv-written-test.com/illinois/cdl/knowledge-test-class-b-1.html?utm_campaign=DMV_-_Search_-_IL_-_EN_-_CDL&utm_adgroup=Class_B&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxc6PBhCEARIsAH8Hff34JnomxmOlR3eRBOQVMPh3dCqkmTLqWpTdLAIbmwcCO-aZnk8nzeAaAtfrEALw_wcB) seems useful. There is also a [part 2](https://www.dmv-written-test.com/illinois/cdl/knowledge-test-class-b-2.html) to the test.

So, I am going to go through each question and answer it with the answer reference to the [pdf](https://www.ilsos.gov/publications/pdf_publications/dsd_cdl10.pdf).

On the pdf I am going to link to a relevant question.

Regarding S-Cam brakes this is a useful [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXnasfyak7Y&ab_channel=WadeBartlett) on how they work.

There are also series of videos like [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOBb7J3hTD8&ab_channel=ABCE-learning) but that takes too long.

> 1\. When driving under wet conditions, what does a lack of spray from other vehicles indicate?

Answer: Ice has formed on the road.

"

2.13.2 – Driving  
Slippery Surfaces. Drive slowly and smoothly on slippery roads. If it is very slippery, you should not drive at all. Stop  
at the first safe place.  
Start Gently and Slowly. When first starting, get the feel of the road. Do not hurry.  
Check for Ice. Check for ice on the road, especially bridges and overpasses. **A lack of spray from other vehicles  
indicates ice has formed on the road**. Also, check your mirrors and wiper blades for ice. If they have ice, the road most  
likely will be icy as well.

"

> 2\. If transporting 30 feet of cargo on a flatbed trailer, you should use a minimum of \_\_\_\_ to restrain the cargo.

Answer: Three tie-downs

"3.3.2 – Cargo Tie-down  
On flatbed trailers or trailers without sides, cargo must be  
secured to keep it from shifting or falling off. In closed vans,  
tie-downs can also be important to prevent cargo shifting that  
may affect the handling of the vehicle. Tie-downs must be of the  
proper type and proper strength. Federal regulations require the  
aggregate working load limit of any securement system used to  
secure an article or group of articles against movement must be  
at least one-half times the weight of the article or group of articles.  
Proper tie-down equipment must be used, including ropes,  
straps, chains and tensioning devices (winches, ratchets,  
clinching components). Tie-downs must be attached to the vehicle correctly (hooks, bolts, rails, rings). (See figure 3.2.)  
**Cargo should have at least one tie-down for each 10 feet of cargo**. Make sure you have enough tie-downs to meet this  
need. No matter how small the cargo, it should have at least two tie-downs."  

> 3\. If you must drive very slowly, you should:

Answer: Warn other motorists.

"2.5.1 – Signal Your Intentions:  
Slowing Down. Warn drivers behind you when you need to slow down. A few light taps on the brake pedal — enough to flash the brake lights — should warn following drivers. Use the four-way emergency flashers for times when you are driving very slowly or are stopped. **Warn other drivers** in any of the following situations"  

> 4\. If a vehicle has air brakes, the air compressor drive belt should be checked before each drive. In what condition should the belt be?

Answer: Tight

"5.3.1 – During Step 2 Engine Compartment Checks:  
Check Air Compressor Drive Belt (if compressor is belt-driven). If the air compressor is belt-driven, check the  
condition and **tightness** of the belt. It should be in good condition."

> 5\. If a tire fails, you should:

Answer: Stay off brakes

"  
2.17.4 – Tire Failure:  
Respond to Tire Failure. When a tire fails, your vehicle is in danger. You must immediately:  
• Hold the Steering Wheel Firmly. If a front tire fails, it can twist the steering wheel out of your hand. The only  
way to prevent this is to keep a firm grip on the steering wheel with both hands at all times.  
• **Stay Off the Brake.** It is natural to want to brake in an emergency. However, braking when a tire has failed  
could cause loss of control. Unless you are about to drive into something, stay off the brake until the vehicle  
has slowed down. Then brake very gently, pull off the road and stop.  
• Check the Tires. After you have come to a stop, get out and check all the tires. Do this even if the vehicle  
seems to be handling normally. If one of your dual tires goes, the only way you may know it is by getting out and  
looking at it."  

> 6\. In cold weather, an alcohol evaporator should be checked and filled:

Answer: Every day

"5.1.5 – Alcohol Evaporator  
Some air brake systems have an alcohol evaporator to put alcohol into the air system. This helps to reduce the risk of  
ice in air brake valves and other parts during cold weather. Ice inside the system can make the brakes stop working.  
Check the alcohol container and fill up as necessary, **every day during cold weather**. Daily air tank drainage is still  
needed to get rid of water and oil (unless the system has automatic drain valves)."

> 7\. What is reaction distance?

Answer: The distance you will continue to travel, in ideal conditions, before you physically hit the brakes in response to a hazard seen ahead.

"2.6.1 – Stopping Distance  
Perception Distance + Reaction Distance + Braking Distance = Total Stopping Distance  
Perception Distance. The distance your vehicle travels, in ideal conditions, from the time your eyes see a hazard  
until your brain recognizes it. Keep in mind, certain mental and physical conditions can affect your perception distance.  
It can be affected greatly depending on visibility and the hazard itself. The average perception time for an alert driver  
is 1 3/4 seconds. At 55 mph, this accounts for 142 feet traveled.**  
Reaction Distance.** The distance you will continue to travel, in ideal conditions, before you physically hit the brakes in response to a hazard seen ahead. The average driver has a reaction time of three-fourths second to one second.  
At 55 mph this accounts for 61 feet traveled."  

> 8\. How should you brake if your vehicle loses its ABS?

Answer: Brake normally

"2.18.7 – Braking If ABS Is Not Working  
• Without ABS, you still have normal brake functions. Drive and brake as you always have.  
• Vehicles with ABS have yellow malfunction lamps to tell you if something is not working.  
• As a system check on newer vehicles, the malfunction lamp comes on at start-up for a bulb check and then  
goes out quickly. On older systems, the lamp could stay on until you are driving over 5 mph.  
• If the lamp stays on after the bulb check or goes on once you are under way, you may have lost ABS control on  
one or more wheels.  
• Remember: If your ABS malfunctions, you still have regular brakes. **Drive normally,** but get the system serviced  
soon"

> 9\. How can a person check for a leak in hydraulic brakes?

Answer: Pump the brake pedal three times and hold the pedal for five seconds. If the pedal moves, there may be a problem.

"STEP 7: Start the Engine and Check  
Test for Hydraulic Leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm  
pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move. If it does, there may be a leak or other  
problem. Get it fixed before driving."

> 10\. How much water needs to be on the surface of a road for a vehicle to hydroplane?

Answer: A small amount

"2.6.2 – Matching Speed to the Road Surface:

**It does not take a lot of water** to cause hydroplaning. Hydroplaning can occur at speeds as low as 30 mph if there is a  
lot of water. Hydroplaning is more likely if tire pressure is low or the tread is worn. (The grooves in a tire carry away the  
water; if they are not deep, they do not work well.)"

> 11\. During the straight line backing exercise, how many times are you permitted to exit the vehicle to check its position?

Answer: One time

"Each time you open the door, move from a seated position where in physical control of the vehicle or, on a bus, walk to the back of a bus to get a better view, it is scored as a look. The maximum number of looks you may use is two for  
all exercises except for the Straight Line Backing exercise, which **allows only one look**."

> 12\. The use of hand-held cell phones while driving:

Answer: Is prohibited.

"Electronic Device Law  
Effective Jan. 1, 2014, Illinois law prohibits the use of hand-held cellphones, texting or using other communication  
devices while operating a motor vehicle"

> 13\. When doing an inspection, make sure your brake pads are:

Answer: Free of oil and grease.

"Bad Brake Drums or Shoes  
• Cracked drums.  
• Shoes or pads with oil, grease or brake fluid on them.  
• Shoes worn to less than 1/4 inch, missing or broken."

> 14\. When inspecting cargo, the driver should do all of the following, except:

Answer: Ensure that the **breakable** items are placed under heavier items

"3.1 – Inspecting Cargo  
As Part of Your Pre-trip Inspection. Make sure the truck is not overloaded and the cargo is balanced and secured  
properly.  
After Starting. Inspect the cargo and its securing devices again within the first 50 miles after beginning a trip. Make  
any adjustments needed.  
Re-check. Re-check the cargo and securing devices as often as necessary during a trip to keep the load secure. You  
need to inspect again:  
• After you have driven for three hours or 150 miles.  
• After every break you take during driving."

> 15\. A tank endorsement is:

Answer: Required when transporting both liquids and gases.

"A tank endorsement is required for certain vehicles  
that transport liquids or gases. The liquid or gas does not have  
to be a hazardous material."

> 16\. Distracted driving:

Answer: Can be caused by physical and/or mental distractions.

"2.9 – Distracted Driving  
Whenever you are driving a vehicle and your attention is not on the road, you are putting yourself, your passengers,  
other vehicles and pedestrians in danger. Distracted driving can result when performing any activity that may shift your  
full attention from the driving task"

> 17\. During an applied leakage test, the maximum leakage rate for a single vehicle with air brakes is:

Answer: 3 psi in one minute.

"Test Air Leakage Rate. With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 psi), turn off the engine, release the parking  
brake (push in) and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles  
and less than 3 psi in one minute for combination vehicles. With the air pressure built up to governor cut-off (120-140  
psi), shut off the engine, chock your wheels (if necessary), release the parking brake (all vehicles) and the tractor  
parking valve (combination vehicle), and fully apply the foot brake. Hold the foot brake for one minute. **Check the air  
gauge to see if the air pressure drops more than 3 pounds in one minute** (single vehicle) or 4 pounds in one minute  
(combination vehicle). If the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in one minute for single vehicles (more than 4 psi for  
combination vehicles), the air loss rate is too much. Check for air leaks and fix before driving the vehicle. Otherwise,  
you could lose your brakes while driving."

> 18\. An applicant will be denied a hazardous materials endorsement if they:

Answer: Are wanted for certain felonies.

"Applicants will be denied or have the hazardous materials endorsement canceled if they:  
• Are not a permanent resident of the United States or are unable to provide proof of lawful status.  
• Renounce their United States citizenship.  
• Are wanted or under indictment for certain felonies.  
• Have a conviction in military or civilian court for **certain felonies**.  
• Have been adjudicated as mentally incompetent or involuntarily committed to a mental institution.  
• Are deemed to pose a security threat as determined by the Transportation Security Administration"

> 19\. If you are being tailgated, you should:

Answer: Allow the vehicle to pass.

"Increase your following distance. Opening up room in front of you will help you avoid having to make sudden  
speed or direction changes. It also **makes it easier for the tailgater to get around you.**"

> 20\. Intrastate carriers must have what information displayed on both sides of their vehicle?

Answer: The permit number

"

Intrastate carriers may not operate any motor vehicle on Illinois highways unless there is a sign painted on or affixed  
to both sides of the vehicle. The trade name, permit number and registration number of the carrier must be shown.  
The letters on the sign must be a minimum of 2-inches high with a 1/2-inch brush stroke.

"

> 21\. When using a turn signal, you should not:

Answer: Allow the turn signal to stay on long after the turn has been completed.

"Turns. There are three rules for using turn signals:  
1\. Signal early. Signal well before you turn. It is the best way to keep others from trying to  
pass you.  
2\. Signal continuously. You need both hands on the wheel to turn safely. Do not cancel the  
signal until you have completed the turn.  
3\. Cancel your signal. Do not forget to turn off your turn signal after you have turned (if you  
do not have self-canceling signals)."

> 22\. Improperly loaded cargo can:

Answer: Injure the driver during a quick stop.

"You must understand basic cargo safety rules to get a CDL. If you load cargo wrong or do not secure it, it can be a danger to others and yourself. Loose cargo that falls off a vehicle can cause traffic problems and others could be hurt  
or killed. Loose cargo could hurt or kill you during a **quick stop** or crash"

> 23\. What is Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)?

Answer: The total weight of a vehicle and its cargo.

"3.2.1 – Definitions You Should Know  
Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)**. The total weight of a single vehicle plus its load**."

> 24\. The air pressure in a dual air brake system should build from 85 to 100 psi within:

Answer: 45 seconds.

"Check Rate of Air Pressure Buildup. When the engine is at operating rpms, the pressure should build from 85 to  
100 psi within 45 seconds in dual air systems. (If the vehicle has larger than minimum air tanks, the buildup time can  
be longer and still be safe. Check the manufacturer's specifications.) In single air systems (pre-1975), typical  
requirements are pressure buildup from 50 to 90 psi within three minutes with the engine at an idle speed of 600-900  
rpms."

> 25\. A danger of a large truck swerving to avoid a hazard is:

Answer: The truck may flip over(?)

"3.2.3 – Do Not Be Top-heavy  
The height of the vehicle's center of gravity is important for safe handling.  
A high center of gravity (cargo piled up high or heavy cargo on top) means  
you are more likely to tip over. It is most dangerous in curves or if you  
have to swerve to avoid a hazard. It is important to distribute the cargo so  
it is as low as possible. Put the heaviest parts of the cargo under the  
lightest parts."

> 26\. When entering a curve, you should:

Answer: Downshift

"Before Entering a Curve. Slow down to a safe speed and **downshift** to the right gear before entering the curve.  
This lets you use some power through the curve to help the vehicle be more stable while turning. It also allows  
you to speed up as soon as you are out of the curve."

> 27\. How many license plates must a truck tractor display?

Answer: One

"License Plates. All vehicles except motorcycles, motorized pedal cycles, trailers, semitrailers, truck tractors and  
vehicles registered under the International Registration Plan (IRP) must display two license plates (front and rear) on  
the vehicle. Trailers must display one on the rear, and **truck tractors must display one on the front.** Buses registered  
under the IRP must display one apportioned plate on the rear of the bus."

> 28\. Of the following, which is not a way to prevent drowsiness during a trip?

Answer: Traveling with a passenger

Driving while fatigued can be extremely dangerous. Strategies for preventing drowsiness while driving include getting a full night's sleep before a trip; having someone ride with you so you can take turns driving; scheduling trips for times during which you are normally awake; and avoiding medications that may cause drowsiness.

> 29\. Sending text messages while driving:

Answer: Is not permitted

> 30\. If you’re unfamiliar with the area in which you must back up, you should:

Answer: Get out of your vehicle and walk around the area to become more familiar with it.

> 31\. If a tire fails, the driver should:

Answer: Not use the brakes.

> 32\. Truck tractors with air brakes built on or after March 1, 1997 must have:

Answer: An Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS).

> 33\. If a load is 10 feet long, it should be secured by at least \_\_\_\_ tie-down(s).

Answer: Two

"Cargo should have at least one tie-down for each 10 feet of cargo. Make sure you have enough tie-downs to meet this  
need. No matter how small the cargo, it should have at least two tie-downs."

> 34\. How often does a truck with a gross weight of more than 8,000 pounds need to be inspected?

Answer: Semi-annually

> 35\. If asked to sight-side back your vehicle into an alley, you should first:

Answer: Pull past the alley and stop parallel to the outer boundary.

> 36\. When driving through a curve during the skills test, you should:

Answer: Reduce your speed before entering the curve.

"Before Entering a Curve. Slow down to a safe speed and downshift to the right gear before entering the curve. This lets you use some power through the curve to help the vehicle be more stable while turning. It also allows you to speed up as soon as you are out of the curve."

> 37\. When asked about the vehicle's oil during the vehicle inspection test, you must be able to do all of the following, except:

Answer: Show that the oil level is below the refill mark

> 38\. Poisonous fumes can enter a truck's cab due to:

Answer: A defective exhaust system.

"Exhaust System Defects. A broken exhaust system can let poison fumes into the cab or sleeper berth."

> 39\. If the air pressure warning light comes on, you should:

Answer: Safely exit the roadway and stop.

"5.4.7 – Low Air Pressure  
If the low air pressure warning comes on, stop and safely park your vehicle as soon as possible. There might be an air  
leak in the system. Controlled braking is possible only while enough air remains in the air tanks. The spring brakes will  
come on when the air pressure drops into the range of 20 to 45 psi. A heavily loaded vehicle will take a long distance  
to stop because the spring brakes do not work on all axles. Lightly loaded vehicles or vehicles on slippery roads may  
skid out of control when the spring brakes come on. It is much safer to stop while there is enough air in the tanks to  
use the foot brakes."

> 40\. Parking brakes:

Answer: Should be tested before a drive.

> 41\. Brake pads should:

Answer: Not have any oil or grease on them.

> 42\. If wheel bearing seals are leaking, you should:

Answer: Get the seals fixed.

> 43\. Stopping distance can be affected by:

Answer: Speed

> 44\. Bridges usually:

Answer: Freeze before other road surfaces.

> 45\. When passing another vehicle, you should:

Answer: Make eye contact with the driver.

"When Passing. Whenever you are about to pass a vehicle, pedestrian or bicyclist, assume that they do not see you."

> 46\. When loading a trailer, it is important to:

Answer: Place an appropriate amount of weight over the axles.

> 47\. When crossing railroad tracks, you should:

Answer: Stay in your lane.

> 48\. A thin layer of ice that forms on road surfaces is called:

Answer: Black ice

> 49\. While driving, if it is discovered a vehicle's ABS is not working, the driver should:

Answer: Brake normally

> 50\. Air tank drains:

Answer: Are used to drain water and compressor oil from the air tank.

I think that the Marinoviches were definitely on to something but I think that they weren't emphasizing overall strength and bulk enough. So the best thing to do is to train in a Maraschino style which produces bulk. I like flywheel training but overall and CKC (Closed Kinetic Chain) exercise is going to be a good idea. The exercise will increase your strength whilst not weakening your kinetic chain.

Next.js with Turso, when building we may run into a parsing error which would be:

```
Failed to compile.
./node_modules/.pnpm/@libsql+client@0.9.0/node_modules/@libsql/client/README.md
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (1:0)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to process this file. See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders

```

A "band-aid" solution to this is to change your next.config.js to parse the parse the files.

A more permanent solution is to change the way and location which you are instantiating drizzle, see in this [GitHub comment](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/issues/1276#issuecomment-2065694434).

Change the imports of Drizzle, see in this [GitHub comment](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-client-ts/issues/184#issuecomment-2025317522).

Another fix could be that you are not marking the appropriate files as  
use server' discussed [here](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-client-ts/issues/184#issuecomment-1988052619).

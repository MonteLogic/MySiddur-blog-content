Opinion on living in Brazil.  
\- Overrated, the weather is hot, like really hot even in Sao Paulo. The women aren't my type because they aren't traditional. The women are career first so dating is hard because career is their main focus.  
Opinion on living in Argentina - Haven't been there in a while. ,  
\- ARG is REALLY underrated and I found a lot of people there to be warm and nice. ARG women are more traditional than Brazilian women but not comparable to a place like Mexico or non-metropolitan Colombia.

Opinion on Minimalist keyboards.

Opinion on Protein Powders.  
\- If you're lactose intolerant and you feel kind of queasy from taking Protein Powder, it'll be a good idea to switch over to a Vegan protein powder as a lot of Whey Protein is dairy protein.

Opinion on Meal Replacements  
\- For meal replacements I like naked pea protein because it comes in a clear container and I can do something with it after, Soylent comes in a container which is plastic and not clear so you can't really put stuff in there or use it as a water recpticle because a clear recipticle is so much better.

So the perfect 'stack' would be a meal replacement which would be in a clear container or be able to be bought in bulk, like huge bulk think 20 kilos+ size.

- Looking into large meal replacement container which are in a sort of aluminum container: Looking at Huel, about 4 dollars per serving. I like WitiWiti Vegan Meal Replacement, Vanilla.

Opinion on Nootropics.  
\- What gets me keep on working is ingesting a lot of Protein as this will help your body in creating amino acids.

Opinion on Learning Yiddish.

- Having progress with recording oneself and then replaying it.

Opinion on Spending less (minimalism)

Opinion on the best blogging platfrom and methods.

- Wordpress doesn't feel like the best, it would be better if I used the gist (GH CLI) backbone and published this way using vim. However, WordPress offers a lot of good things out of the box, also the headless solutions just seem confusing when we are looking for something simple and easy to spinup. Gutenberg is really cumbersome and feels slow at times. Also, there should be really good spam/bot detection for your blogs so you're not reading false values. I also believe that there still isn't a perfect blogging option for the layman, WordPress needs a lot of setup and maintenance, blogger doesn't offer enough customizations. Also, this blog platform or a blog stack for layman and developers respectively, would have great backup options for backing up content. Also, the solution shouldn't cost ANYTHING more than 5 dollars a month!!

- Ideally the blog could be downloaded and searched quickly.

- Blogger from Google is good as well.

- The blog should offer easy ways to sign via Social sign up and sign in (GitHub, Google, etc.) so commenting and interacting is good.

- My opinion is that the blog should server the blog writer. I look up a lot of stuff of what I did 2 years ago because I just forgot.

Best Vim hotkeys, +i

My coding music playlist  
\- Ideally there would be no music. But studies show music increases your energy and inspiration.

What my diet looks like, (include date and how its changed over time) my diet is very cost economical in time of consumption, cost and time of acquiring food.

Best plan right now for escaping the Matrix. +i

I would work in America, save up money, then go to Mexico and buy a house in one of the **perfect climate zones** so that way you don't have to keep on moving around--or otherwise known as snowbirding also, places where infrastructure is VERY easy to maintain.

You can put a tiny home in that perfect micro climate in Mexico but you won't really have any protections from outside criminals. The tiny home option could be good if you live in the USA and find some nice place to live due to it being safer in the US.

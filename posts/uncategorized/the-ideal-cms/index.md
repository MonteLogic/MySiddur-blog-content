Within Gutenberg within an element I would like to hit a hotkey which would turn  
it into a heading say (ctrl+shift+H)

I would use the Google Analytics template rather than Vercel Web Analytics because you can move out of Vercel easier. But there would also be a difficulty in settings it up.

Currently I am using Vercel Analytics due to not being in spec for the Next.js Google Analytics component but I would like to use Google Analytics in the future on a pre-existing Next.js 15+ project

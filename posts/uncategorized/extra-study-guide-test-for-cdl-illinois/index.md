Subsection 2.1

1\. What is the most important reason for doing a vehicle inspection?

\- Safety

2\. What things should you check during a trip?

• Watch gauges for signs of trouble.  
• Use your senses to check for problems (look, listen, smell, feel).  
• Check critical items when stopping:  
— Tires, wheels and rims.  
— Brakes.  
— Lights and reflectors.  
— Brake and electrical connections to trailer.  
— Trailer coupling devices.  
— Cargo securement devices

  
3\. Name some key steering system parts.

\- Steering wheel  
\- Steering arm  
\- Steering wheel shaft  
\- Tie rod  
\- Steering gear box  
\- Pitman arm  
\- Drag link  
\- Steering ring knuckle  
\- Spindle

4\. Name some suspension system defects.

The suspension system holds up the vehicle and its load. It keeps the axles in place.  
Therefore, broken suspension parts can be extremely dangerous. Look for the following:

- Spring hangers that allow movement of the axle from proper position. (See Figure 2.2.)

- Cracked or broken spring hangers.

- Missing or broken leaves in any leaf spring. If one-fourth or more is missing, it will put the vehicle “out of service,”  
    but any defect could be dangerous. (See Figure 2.3.)

- Broken leaves in a multileaf spring or leaves that have shifted so they might hit a tire or other part.

- Leaking shock absorbers.

- Torque rod or arm, U-bolts, spring hangers or other axle positioning parts that are cracked, damaged or missing.

- Air suspension systems that are damaged and/or leaking. (See Figure 2.4.)

- Any loose, cracked, broken or missing frame members.

5\. What three kinds of emergency equipment must you have?

• Fire extinguisher(s).  
• Spare electrical fuses (unless equipped with circuit breakers).  
• Warning devices for parked vehicles (for example, three reflective warning triangles, six fuses or three liquid  
burning flares)

6\. What is the minimum tread depth for front tires? For other tires?

At least 4/32-inch tread depth is required in every major groove on front tires. A 2/32-inch tread depth is required on other tires.

7\. Name some things you should check on the front of your vehicle during the walk-around inspection.

Go to front of vehicle and check that low beams are on and both of the four-way flashers are working.  
• Driver's door glass should be clean.  
• Door latches or locks should work properly.  
• Left front wheel:  
— Condition of wheel and rim — missing, bent, broken studs, clamps, lugs or any signs of misalignment.  
— Condition of tires — properly inflated, valve stem and cap OK, no serious cuts, bulges or tread wear.  
— Use wrench to test rust-streaked lug nuts, indicating looseness.  
— Hub oil level OK, no leaks.  
• Left front suspension:  
— Condition of spring, spring hangers, shackles and U-bolts.  
— Shock absorber condition.  
• Left front brake:  
— Condition of brake drum or disc.  
— Condition of hoses.  
Front  
• Condition of front axle.  
• Condition of steering system:  
— No loose, worn, bent, damaged or missing parts.  
— Must grab steering mechanism to test for looseness.  
• Condition of windshield:  
— Check for damage and clean if dirty.  
— Check windshield wiper arms for proper spring tension.  
— Check wiper blades for damage, “stiff” rubber and securement.  
• Lights and reflectors:  
— Parking, clearance and identification lights clean, operating and proper color (amber at front).  
— Reflectors clean and proper color (amber at front).  
— Right front turn signal light clean, operating and proper color (amber or white on signals facing forward)

8\. What should wheel bearing seals be checked for?

Wheel bearing/seals not leaking.

9\. How many red reflective triangles should you carry?

Three red reflective triangles.

10\. How do you test hydraulic brakes for leaks?

Test for Hydraulic Leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm  
pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move. If it does, there may be a leak or other  
problem. Get it fixed before driving

11\. Why put the starter switch key in your pocket during the pre-trip inspection?

Someone might move the vehicle while you are checking underneath it.

Subsections 2.2 and 2.3

1\. Why should you back toward the driver's side?

because someone might move the vehicle while you are checking underneath it.

2\. If stopped on a hill, how can you start moving without rolling back?

Put on the parking brake whenever necessary to keep from rolling back. Release the parking brake only when you have applied enough engine power to keep from rolling back.

3\. When backing, why is it important to use a helper?

Use a Helper. Use a helper when you can. There are blind spots you cannot see, so a helper is important. The helper should stand near the back of your vehicle where you can see the helper. Before you begin backing, work out a set of  
hand signals that you both understand. Agree on a signal for “stop.

4\. What's the most important hand signal that you and the helper should agree on?

Stop

5\. What are the two special conditions where you should downshift?

Special conditions where you should downshift are:  
• **Before Starting Down a Hill.** Slow down and shift down to a speed that you can control without using the brakes hard. Otherwise, the brakes can overheat and lose their braking power. Downshift before starting down the hill. Make sure you are in a low enough gear, usually lower than the gear required to climb the same hill.  
• **Before Entering a Curve.** Slow down to a safe speed and downshift to the right gear before entering the curve. This lets you use some power through the curve to help the vehicle be more stable while turning. It also allows you to speed up as soon as you are out of the curve.

6\. When should you downshift automatic transmissions?

2.3.3 – Automatic Transmissions  
Some vehicles have automatic transmissions. You can select a low range to get greater engine braking when going  
down grades. The lower ranges prevent the transmission from shifting up beyond the selected gear (unless the governor  
rpm is exceeded). It is important to use this braking effect **when going down grades**.  

7\. Retarders keep you from skidding when the road is slippery. True or False?

**False**

2.3.4 – Retarders  
Some vehicles have “retarders,” which help slow a vehicle and reduce the need for using the brakes. They reduce brake wear and give you another way to slow down

Caution: When your drive wheels have poor traction, the retarder may cause them to skid. Therefore, you should turn  
the retarder off whenever the road is wet, icy or snow covered.  

8\. What are the two ways to know when to shift?

There are two ways of knowing when to shift:  
1\. Use Engine Speed (rpm). Study the driver's manual for your vehicle and learn the operating rpm range. Watch  
your tachometer and shift up when your engine reaches the top of the range. (Some newer vehicles use  
“progressive” shifting: the rpm at which you shift becomes higher as you move up in the gears. Find out what's  
right for the vehicle you will operate.)  
2\. Use Road Speed (mph). Learn what speeds each gear is good for. Then, by using the speedometer, you will  
know when to shift up.

Subsections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6

1\. How far ahead does the manual say you should look?

Most good drivers look at least 12 to 15 seconds ahead. That means looking ahead the distance you will travel in 12 to 15 seconds.

2\. What are two main things to look for ahead?

Most good drivers look at least 12 to 15 seconds ahead. That means looking ahead the distance you will travel in 12 to 15 seconds.

3\. What's your most important way to see the sides and rear of your vehicle?

"It's important to know what's going on behind and to the sides. Check your mirror regularly." (p.2-11)

"You need to make regular checks of your mirrors to be aware of traffic and to check your vehicle." (p.2-11)

4\. What does “communicating” mean in safe driving?

Signaling your intentions and communicating your presence.

See 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 (p. 2-12)

5\. Where should your reflectors be placed when stopped on a divided highway?

10', 100', and 200' behind the vehicle (p.2-13)

6\. What three things add up to total stopping distance?

perception distance + reaction distance + braking distance = total stopping distance (p.2-14)

7\. If you go twice as fast, will your stopping distance increase by two or four times?

"When you double your speed from 20 to 40 mph the impact is 4 times greater." (p.2-14)

8\. Empty trucks have the best braking. True or False?

False!

"The heavier the vehicle, the more work the brakes must do to stop it, and the more heat they absorb. But the brakes, tires, springs, and sock absorbers on heavy vehicles are designed to work best when the vehicle is fully loaded. Empty trucks require greater stopping distances because an empty vehicle has less traction." (p.2.14)

9\. What is hydroplaning?

"It's like skiing--the tires lose their contact with the road and have little or no traction. You may not be able to steer or brake." (p.2-15)

10\. What is “black ice”?

"Black ice is a thin layer that is clear enough that you can see the road underneath it. It makes the road look wet." (p. 2-12)

Subsections 2.7 and 2.8

1\. How do you find out how many seconds of following distance space you have?

To know how much space you have, wait until the vehicle ahead passes a shadow on the road, a pavement marking  
or some other clear landmark. Then count off the seconds like this: “one thousand- and-one, one thousand-and-two”  
and so on, until you reach the same spot. Compare your count with the rule of one second for every 10 feet of length.

2\. If you are driving a 30-foot vehicle at 55 mph, how many seconds of following distance should you allow?

Answer: **4 seconds**

One good rule says you need at least one second for each 10  
feet of vehicle length at speeds below 40 mph. At greater speeds, you  
must add one second for safety. For example, if you are driving a  
40-foot vehicle, you should leave four seconds between you and the  
vehicle ahead. In a 60-foot rig, you will need six seconds. Over 40  
mph, you would need five seconds for a 40-foot vehicle and seven  
seconds for a 60-foot vehicle. (See Figure 2.12.)

Three seconds because of 10 feet for one second. Additionally because the speed is greater than 40 add another second, so **4 seconds**.

3\. You should decrease your following distance if somebody is following you too closely. True or False?

Answer: **False**

Increase your following distance. Opening up room in front of you will help you to avoid having to make sudden speed or direction changes. It also makes it easier for the tailgater to get around you

4\. If you swing wide to the left before turning right, another driver may try to pass you on the right. True or False?

True.

turn wide as you complete the turn. Keep the rear of your vehicle close to the curb. This will stop other drivers from passing you on the right. Don't turn wide to the left as you start the turn. A following driver may think you are turning left and try to pass you on the right. You may crash into the other vehicle as you complete your turn.

5\. What is a hazard?

A hazard is any road condition or other road user (driver, bicyclist, pedestrian) that is a possible danger.

6\. Why make emergency plans when you see a hazard?

When you see a hazard, think about the emergencies that could develop and figure out what you would do. Always be prepared to take action based on your plans. In this way, you will be a prepared, defensive driver who will improve your own safety as well as the safety of all road users.

Subsections 2.9 and 2.10

1\. What are some tips to follow so you won’t become a distracted driver?

Review and be totally familiar with all safety and usage features on any in-vehicle electronics, including your wireless or cell phone, before you drive. Pre-program radio stations. Pre-load you favorite CDs or cassette tapes. Clear the vehicle of any unnecessary objects. Review maps and plan your route before you begin driving. Adjust all mirrors for best all-round visibility before you start your trip. Don't attempt to read or write while you drive. Avoid smoking, eating and drinking while you drive. Don't engage in complex or emotionally intense conversations with other occupants.

2\. How do you use in-vehicle communications equipment cautiously?

When possible, pull off the road in a safe, legal place when making/ receiving a call on communication equipment. If possible, turn the cell phone off until your destination is reached. Position the cell phone within easy reach. Pre-program cell phones with commonly called numbers. If you have to place a call, find a safe place to pull off the road. Do not place a call while driving. Some jurisdictions require that only hands-free devices can be used while driving. Even these devices are unsafe to use when you are moving down the road. If you must use your cell phone, keep conversations short. Develop ways to get free of long-winded friends and associates while on the road. Never use the cell phone for social visiting. Hang up in tricky traffic situations. Do not use the equipment when approaching locations with heavy traffic, road construction, heavy pedestrian traffic, or severe weather conditions. Do not attempt to type or read messages on your satellite system while driving.

3\. How do you recognize a distracted driver?

Watch for: Vehicles that may drift over the lane divider lines or within their own lane. Vehicles traveling at inconsistent speeds. Drivers who are preoccupied with maps, food, cigarettes, cell phones, or other objects. Drivers who appear to be involved in conversations with their passengers.

4\. What is the difference between aggressive driving and road rage?

Aggressive driving is the act of operating a motor vehicle in a selfish, bold, or pushy manner, without regard for the rights or safety of others. Road rage is operating a motor vehicle with the intent of doing harm to others or physically assaulting a driver or their vehicle.

5\. What should you do when confronted with an aggressive driver?

First and foremost, make every attempt to get out of their way. Put your pride in the back seat. Do not challenge them by speeding up or attempting to hold-yourown in your travel lane. Avoid eye contact. Ignore gestures and refuse to react to them. Report aggressive drivers to the appropriate authorities by providing a vehicle description, license number, location and, if possible, direction of travel. If you have a cell phone, and can do it safely, call the police. If an aggressive driver is involved in a crash farther down the road, stop a safe distance from the crash scene, wait for the police to arrive, and report the driving behavior that you witnessed.

6\. What are some things you can do to reduce your stress before and while you drive?

Reduce your stress before and while you drive. Listen to "easy listening"music. Give the drive your full attention. Don't allow yourself to become distracted by talking on your cell phone, eating, etc. Be realistic about your travel time. Expect delays because of traffic, construction, or bad weather and make allowances. If you're going to be later than you expected -deal with it. Take a deep breath and accept the delay. Give other drivers the benefit of the doubt. Try to imagine why he or she is driving that way. Whatever their reason, it has nothing to do with you. Slow down and keep your following distance reasonable. Don't drive slowly in the left lane of traffic. Avoid gestures. Keep you hands on the wheel. Avoid making any gestures that might anger another driver, even seemingly harmless expressions of irritation like shaking your head. Be a cautious and courteous driver. If another driver seems eager to get in front of you, say, "Be my guest." This response will soon become a habit and you won't be as offended by other drivers' actions.

Subsections 2.11, 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14

1\. You should use low beams whenever you can. True or False?

False.

Use High Beams When You Can. Some drivers make the mistake of always using low beams. This seriously cuts down on their ability to see ahead. Use high beams when it is safe and legal to do so. Use them when you are not within 500 feet of an approaching vehicle.

2\. What should you do before you drive if you are drowsy?

If you are drowsy, sleep before you drive! Even a nap can save your life or the lives of others.

3\. What effects can wet brakes cause? How can you avoid these problems?

When driving in heavy rain or deep standing water, your brakes will get wet. Water in the brakes can cause the brakes to be weak, to apply unevenly, or to grab. This can cause lack of braking power, wheel lockups, pulling to one side or the other, and jackknife if you pull a trailer. Avoid driving through deep puddles or flowing water if possible. If not, you should: Slow down and place transmission in a low gear. Gently put on the brakes. This presses linings against brake drums or discs and keeps mud, silt, sand, and water from getting in. Increase engine rpm and cross the water while keeping light pressure on the brakes. When out of the water, maintain light pressure on the brakes for a short distance to heat them up and dry them out. Make a test stop when safe to do so. Check behind to make sure no one is following, then apply the brakes to be sure they work well. If not, dry them out further as described above. (CAUTION: Do not apply too much brake pressure and accelerator at the same time, or you can overheat brake drums and linings.)

4\. You should let air out of hot tires so the pressure goes back to normal. True or False?

False.

Air pressure increases with temperature. Do not let air out or the pressure will be too low when the tires cool off. If a tire is too hot to touch, remain stopped until the tire cools off. Otherwise the tire may blow out or catch fire.

5\. You can safely remove the radiator cap as long as the engine isn't overheated. True or False?

5\. You can safely remove the radiator cap as long as the engine isn't overheated. True or False?

Subsections 2.15 and 2.16

1\. What factors determine your selection of a "safe" speed when going down a long, steep downgrade?

Your most important consideration is to select a speed that is not too fast for the: Total weight of the vehicle and cargo. Length of the grade. Steepness of the grade. Road conditions. Weather.

2\. Why should you be in the proper gear before starting down a hill?

Do not try to downshift after your speed has already built up. You will not be able to shift into a lower gear. You may not even be able to get back into any gear and all engine braking effect will be lost. Forcing an automatic transmission into a lower gear at high speed could damage the transmission and also lead to loss of all engine braking effect.

3\. Describe the proper braking technique when going down a long, steep downgrade.

The use of brakes on a long and/or steep downgrade is only a supplement to the braking effect of the engine. Once the vehicle is in the proper low gear, the following are the proper braking techniques: Apply the brakes just hard enough to feel a definite slowdown. When your speed has been reduced to approximately five mph below your "safe" speed, release the brakes. (This brake application should last for about three seconds.) When your speed has increased to your "safe" speed, repeat steps 1 and 2. For example, if your "safe" speed is 40 mph, you would not apply the brakes until your speed reaches 40 mph. You now apply the brakes hard enough to gradually reduce your speed to 35 mph and then release the brakes. Repeat this as often as necessary until you have reached the end of the downgrade.

4\. What type of vehicles can get stuck on a railroad-highway crossing?

Be Aware! These trailers can get stuck on raised crossings: Low slung units (lowboy, car carrier, moving van, possum-belly livestock trailer). Single-axle tractor pulling a long trailer with its landing gear set to accommodate a tandem-axle tractor.

5\. How long does it take for a typical tractor-trailer unit to clear a double track?

It takes a typical tractor trailer unit at least 14 seconds to clear a single track and more than 15 seconds to clear a double track.

Subsections 2.17, 2.18 and 2.19

1\. Stopping is not always the safest thing to do in an emergency. True or False?

True.

Stopping is not always the safest thing to do in an emergency. When you don't have enough room to stop, you may have to steer away from what's ahead. Remember, you can almost always turn to miss an obstacle more quickly than you can stop. (However, top-heavy vehicles and tractors with multiple trailers may flip over.)

2\. What are some advantages of going right instead of left around an obstacle?

If an oncoming driver has drifted into your lane, a move to your right is best. If that driver realizes what has happened, the natural response will be to return to his or her own lane.

If the shoulder is clear, going right may be best. No one is likely to be driving on the shoulder but someone may be passing you on the left. You will know if you have been using your mirrors.

If you are blocked on both sides, a move to the right may be best. At least you won't force anyone into an opposing traffic lane and a possible head-on collision.

3\. What is an "escape ramp?"

Escape ramps have been built on many steep mountain downgrades. Escape ramps are made to stop runaway vehicles safely without injuring drivers and passengers. Escape ramps use a long bed of loose, soft material to slow a runaway vehicle, sometimes in combination with an upgrade.

4\. If a tire blows out, you should put the brakes on hard to stop quickly. True or False?

False.

Stay Off the Brake. It's natural to want to brake in an emergency. However, braking when a tire has failed could cause loss of control. Unless you're about to run into something, stay off the brake until the vehicle has slowed down. Then brake very gently, pull off the road, and stop.

5\. How do you know if your vehicle has anti lock brakes?

Tractors, trucks, and buses will have yellow ABS malfunction lamps on the instrument panel.

6\. What is the proper braking technique when driving a vehicle with anti lock brakes?

Brake the same way, regardless of whether you have ABS on the bus, tractor, the trailer, or both.

7\. How do anti lock brakes help you?

Brake pressure is adjusted to provide the maximum braking without danger of lockup. ABS works far faster than the driver can respond to potential wheel lockup. At all other times the brake system will operate normally.

Subsections 2.20 and 2.21

1\. What are some things to do at an accident scene to prevent another accident?

If your vehicle is involved in the accident, try to get it to the side of the road. This will help prevent another accident and allow traffic to move. If you're stopping to help, park away from the accident. The area immediately around the accident will be needed for emergency vehicles. Put on your flashers. Set out reflective triangles to warn other traffic. Make sure other drivers can see them in time to avoid the accident.

2\. Name two causes of tire fires.

Under-inflated tires and duals that touch.

3\. What kinds of fires is a B:C extinguisher not good for?

Wood, paper and cloth.

The B:C type fire extinguisher is designed to work on electrical fires and burning liquids. The A:B:C type is designed to work on burning wood, paper, and cloth as well.

4\. When using your extinguisher, should you get as close as possible to the fire?

No.

When using the extinguisher, stay as far away from the fire as possible. Aim at the source or base of the fire, not up in the flames.

5\. Name some causes of vehicle fires.

The following are some causes of vehicle fires: After Accidents. Spilled fuel, improper use of flares. Tires. Under-inflated tires and duals that touch. Electrical System. Short circuits due to damaged insulation, loose connections. Fuel. Driver smoking, improper fueling, loose fuel connections. Cargo. Flammable cargo, improperly sealed or loaded cargo, poor ventilation.

Subsections 2.22, 2.23 and 2.24

1\. Common medicines for colds can make you sleepy. True or False?

True.

Avoid Medication. Many medicines can make you sleepy. Those that do have a label warning against operating vehicles or machinery. The most common medicine of this type is an ordinary cold pill. If you have to drive with a cold, you are better off suffering from the cold than from the effects of the medicine.

2\. What should you do if you become sleepy while driving?

Keep Cool. A hot, poorly ventilated vehicle can make you sleepy. Keep the window or vent cracked open or use the air conditioner, if you have one.

Stop to Sleep. When your body needs sleep, sleep is the only thing that will work. If you have to make a stop anyway, make it whenever you feel the first signs of sleepiness, even if it is earlier than you planned. By getting up a little earlier the next day, you can keep on schedule without the danger of driving while you are not alert.

Take Breaks. Short breaks can keep you alert. But the time to take them is before you feel really drowsy or tired.

Stop often. Walk around and inspect your vehicle. It may help to do some physical exercises.

Take a Nap. If you can't stop for the night, at least pull off at a safe place, such as a rest area or truck stop, and take a nap. A nap as short as a half-hour will do more to overcome fatigue than a half-hour coffee stop. Be sure to take a mid-afternoon break and plan to sleep between midnight and 6 a.m.

Recognize the Danger Signals of Drowsy Driving. Sleep is not voluntary. If you're drowsy, you can fall asleep and never even know it. If you are drowsy, you are likely to have "micro sleeps"- brief naps that last around four or five seconds. At 55 miles an hour, that's more than 100 yards, and plenty of time for a crash.

Avoid Drugs. There are no drugs that can overcome being tired. While they may keep you awake for a while, they won't make you alert. And eventually, you'll be even more tired than if you hadn't taken them at all. Sleep is the only thing that can overcome fatigue. Do Not. Do not rely on coffee or another source of caffeine to keep you awake. Do not count on the radio, an open window, or other tricks to keep you awake.

3\. Coffee and a little fresh air will help a drinker sober up. True or False?

False.

The liver can only process one-third an ounce of alcohol per hour, which is considerably less than the alcohol in a standard drink. This is a fixed rate, so only time, not black coffee or a cold shower, will sober you up.

4\. What is a hazardous materials placard?

Placards are signs put on the outside of a vehicle that identify the hazard class of the cargo. A placarded vehicle must have at least four identical placards. They are put on the front, rear, and both sides. Placards must be readable from all four directions.

5\. Why are placards used?

The intent of the rules is to: Contain the product. Communicate the risk. Ensure safe drivers and equipment.

6\. What is “sleep debt”?

If you don't sleep enough, you "owe" more sleep to yourself. This debt can only be paid off by sleeping. You can't overcome it with willpower, and it won't go away by itself.

7\. What are the danger signals of drowsy driving?

Your eyes close or go out of focus by themselves. You have trouble keeping your head up. You can't stop yawning. You have wandering, disconnected thoughts. You don't remember driving the last few miles. You drift between lanes, tailgate, or miss traffic signs. You keep jerking the truck back into the lane. You have drifted off the road and narrowly missed crashing.

Subsection 5.1

1\. Why must air tanks be drained?

Water and compressor oil can get inside of the tank and can freeze in cold weather and cause brake failure.

2\. What is a supply pressure gauge used for?

It tells you how much pressure is in the air tanks

3\. All vehicles with air brakes must have a low air pressure warning signal. True or False?

True

4\. What are spring brakes?

a heavy spring that will engage the brakes if all air is out of the brake system

5\. Front-wheel brakes are good under all conditions. True or False?

TRUE: Front-wheel braking is good under all conditions. Tests show that front-wheel skids from braking are not likely even on ice.

6\. How do you know if your vehicle is equipped with anti lock brakes?

Vehicles with ABS have yellow malfunction lamps to tell you if something isn't working.

Subsection 5.2 and 5.3

1\. What is a dual air brake system?

A dual air brake system has two separate air brake systems, which use a single set of brake controls. Each system has its own air tanks, hoses, lines, etc.

2\. What are the slack adjusters?

Slack Adjusters are on S-cam Brakes. If a slack adjuster moves more than about one inch where the push rod attaches to it, it probably needs adjustment.

3\. How can you check slack adjusters?

Release the parking brakes so you can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that you can reach. If a slack adjuster moves more than about one inch where the push rod attaches to it, it probably needs adjustment.

4\. How can you test the low pressure warning signal?

Shut the engine off when you have enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on and step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. The low air pressure warning signal must come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank (or tank with the lowest air pressure, in dual air systems).

5\. How can you check that the spring brakes come on automatically?

Continue to fan off the air pressure by stepping on and off the brake pedal to reduce tank pressure. The tractor protection valve and parking brake valve should close (pop out) on a tractor-trailer combination vehicle and the parking brake valve should close (pop out) on other combination and single vehicle types when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification (20 - 45 psi).

6\. What are the maximum leakage rates?

With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 psi), turn off the engine, release the parking brake (push in); and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than two psi in one minute for single vehicles and less than three psi in one minute for combination vehicles.

Subsection 5.4

1\. Why should you be in the proper gear before starting down a hill?

To provide engine braking effect while in low gear on a down grade.

  
2\. What factors can cause brakes to fade or fail?

Excessive use of the service brakes results in overheating and leads to brake fade. Brake fade results from excessive heat causing chemical changes in the brake lining, which reduce friction, and also causing expansion of the brake drums.

3\. The use of brakes on a long, steep downgrade is only a supplement to the braking effect of the engine. True  
or False?

True. The use of brakes on a long and/or steep downgrade is only a supplement to the braking effect of the engine.

4\. If you are away from your vehicle only a short time, you do not need to use the parking brake. True or False?

False. Any time you park, use the parking brakes, except if the brakes are very hot (from just having come down a steep grade), or if the brakes are very wet in freezing temperatures.

5\. How often should you drain air tanks?

You must drain the tanks yourself at the end of each day of driving.

6\. How do you brake when you drive a tractor-trailer combination with ABS?

When you drive a tractor-trailer combination with ABS, you should brake as you always have. In other words:  
Use only the braking force necessary to stop safely and stay in control.  
Brake the same way, regardless of whether you have ABS on the tractor, the trailer, or both.

7\. You still have normal brake functions if your ABS is not working. True or False?

No, raise the landing gear all the way up.

5\. How do you know if your trailer is equipped with anti lock brakes?

All trailers and converter dollies built on or after March 1, 1998, are required to have ABS. Trailers will have yellow ABS malfunction lamps on the left side either on the front or rear corner. Look under the vehicle for wheel speed sensors coming from the back tires if you are unsure.

Subsection 6.5

1\. Which shut-off valves should be open and which closed?

All shut-off valve should be open except the shut-off valve on the rear of last trailer

2\. How can you test that air flows to all trailers?

Use the tractor parking brake and/or chock the wheels to hold the vehicle. Wait for air pressure to reach normal, then push In the red "trailer air supply" this will supply air to the emergency side. Use the trailer hand brake to supply are to the service side .open the shut of valves on the rear trailer from the service and emergency side

3\. How can you test the tractor parking valve?

Have truck air supply full at normal range push in the air supply knob in pump the brakes the trailer protection valve should pop out when the air pressure within 20-45 psi

4\. How can you test the trailer emergency brakes?

Charge the trailer air brake system and check that the trailer rolls freely then stop and pull out the trailer air supply control pull gently on the trailer with the tractor to check that the trailer emergency brakes are on.

5\. How can you test the trailer service brakes?

Check for normal Air pressure, release the parking brakes, move the vehicle forward slowly, and apply trailer brakes with the hand control (trolley valve) if so equipped. You should fill the brakes come on. This tells you the trailer brakes are connected and working

Section 8

1\. How are bulkheads different from baffles?

Some liquid tanks are divided into several smaller tanks by bulkheads  
Baffled liquid tanks have bulkheads in them with holes that let the liquid flow through

2\. Should a tank vehicle take curves, on-ramps or off-ramps at the posted speed limits?

Slow down before curves, then accelerate slightly through the curve. The posted speed for a curve may be too fast for a tank vehicle… NO

3\. How are smooth bore tankers different to drive than those with baffles?

Un-baffled liquid tankers (sometimes called "smooth bore" tanks) have nothing inside to slow down the flow of the liquid. Therefore, forward-and back surge is very strong

4\. What three things determine how much liquid you can load?

- The amount the liquid will expand in transit.

- The weight of the liquid.

- Legal weight limits.

5\. What is outage?

Liquids expand as they warm and you must leave room for the expanding liquid. This is called "outage."

6\. How can you help control surge?

Keep a steady pressure on the brakes. DO NOT release too soon when coming to a stop. Brake far in advance of a stop and increase your following distance .

7\. What two reasons make special care necessary when driving tank vehicles?

Because of the high center of gravity and the surge of the liquid you must start, slow down and stop very smoothly. Also make smooth turns and lane changes

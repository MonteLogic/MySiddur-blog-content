It's good but not worth 32 USD a month. It can give in-depth code analysis but it's not at the point where it can substitute half of what an expert of a certain stack can offer in a code review.

## Couldn't Find Complex Issues

I think it can be a great learning tool and something to do to prepare for a code review but I think you'll get a way better return if you embrace TSDoc.

It offers a lot and really what I am looking for are systems and issues with things not being feasible rather than some part of the code base being too intricate/complex.

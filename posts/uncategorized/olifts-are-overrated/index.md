They are very hard on the body,

take for instance one of the reasons Clarence0 states for his bad squat form is because of the injuries he's sustained.

My training is deep pause squats for form 5 x 3, nordic curls to increase my base strength, once I can squat 3 plates, then I'm going to get the SquatMax MD and work there.

To emulate the "storied" overloading eccentric in the catch phase of the Power Clean just do rapid drops. And a way to do this better is to implement a VBT device to better protoype the exercise.

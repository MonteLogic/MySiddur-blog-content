Whenever. You have like a day where you want to have off, or you have just like a day where you're not feeling it. It might just be code block. And then whenever I have code block, I drink some beer, then my code block goes away, and then I'm mysteriously fix all my problems with the code. I don't know why beer helps so much.

I respect the Muslims interests and not drinking alcohol and as well as certain Christian sects not drinking alcohol. I wish there was a way I could cultivate the great. Code helping ability that beard gives into like a different supplement so that it can be given to a much wider audience.

Drinking milk really help with code block. Drink like 2 liters of milk and you'll get rid of code block.

From a supplement standpoint what works better than creatine and BCAA is the supplement from [Qualia](https://www.amazon.com/Supplement-Nootropic-Concentration-L-Theanine-40/dp/B09BW4RYFW/ref=sr_1_13?crid=1F8ST34VBJ31T&keywords=qualia&qid=1671397321&sprefix=qualia%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-13).

What it really does is send more blood to your brain which is what you need to get rid of that code block.

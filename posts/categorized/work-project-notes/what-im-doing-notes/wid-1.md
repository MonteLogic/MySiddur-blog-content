I want this as a Markdown post.


üî¥Ô∏è Make MoLogTraining blog good. 
I could have MoLogTraining goals on m99.sh but have all of the implementations on m99.sh or just a quick link. 

It'll just say Fitness and link to MoLogTrain.com/goals



-- ‚úîÔ∏èWrite content 
--(pause) Make MoLogTraining blog good


-‚úîÔ∏è Get MoL blog on Vercel using Next.js with MoL Blog Stack
-- ‚úîÔ∏è Setup private vs. public logic for posts.
-- üü¢ Code bounties
-- Make courses 



- Fix CBud Issues
-- Send more traffic.

- Make CBud blog good.

- Get MoL blog on Vercel using Next.js with MoL Blog Stack

- Go back to Freelancing

- Make that healthcare profiler a product

- Use the same logic for the healthcare profiler, to make an Upwork resume generator.



Notes:

What do I want to accomplish? 


I really want to get those flashcards good for Yiddish Lang like

, I also want to establish private vs. public posts. 

So I'm going to get private vs. public logic good, so I can write those personal notes. 

Okay, so courses is going to take a while, so I'd rather, just get to work on those code bounties. 



Okay, now that I got the blog looking good I am going to go on the hunt for these Exepsnify issues. 



... 

I think its TOO much work to get my 10 meter fly down to .90 seconds with my current training regime. 




## On training:

I only want to train 8 hours a week as for my study habits for exercise, I don't SEE myself 


Like, Why I gotta go to Fit Club? 

I understand water work helps tendon health but, 


If I had a manual treadmill this would remarkably reduce my training time. 


.... 



## Month of May 2025 - first entry.

I think I'm going to make MySiddur with the business logic on the front page. 


With credits rather than a monthly thing for resupplying, then I'm going to apply the same scheme to CBud as well as add a blog to CBud.


Then do XCertified.io where I teach the in demand very niche skills which don't have a certification but are looked for on Upwork. 

Before the end of the year I would like to transform LLM-viz into a general visualization web app using the same aesthetics.

I assume this would work in Ubuntu but not for sure.

Okay, so ..... I read on their website they have paths to Mac machines listed as, `~/Library/Application Support/Local/blueprints`. So my past experience says that I have seen that capitalized Local folder in the root somewhere, so let's search. Â 

Okay, so I found this folder in /opt/Local

Okay, I did a search and I found the path to Blueprints at

/home/monte/.config/Local/blueprints.

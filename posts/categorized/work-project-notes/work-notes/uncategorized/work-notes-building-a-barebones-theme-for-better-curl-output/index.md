I had this problem in [another post](https://montelogic.com/?p=2959):

"Seeing what's in the checkout page, I need to work hard to get that checkout page as small as plausible to make it easier for me to consume.

There's so much boilerplate/cruft that I'm probably going to have to make a "clean space" to put the outputs I want.

I wonder what the checkout page would look like on a minimum theme, no styling, just enough to get the checkout page to show."

Doing this will speed up development tremendously due to the fact that I won't need to open the webpage viz. open the page and refresh it.

This will also speed up the development of Extended Checkout.

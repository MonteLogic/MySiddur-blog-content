I want to add another block which generates a random tag number of 6 characters and it'll have, "\[ \]" next to it to show if it's done or not.

The plugin crashes when the time logger is attempted to be deleted.

For the toDo: with the numbers, I don't want it to be a paragraph, I want to be able to see all refecences to that toDo, when you click on the top toDo's id element.

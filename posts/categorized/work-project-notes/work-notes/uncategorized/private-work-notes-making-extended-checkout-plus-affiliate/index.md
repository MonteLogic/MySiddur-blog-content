I would like an affiliate program in order to test out the functionality of EC plus fundraisers. I am currently not in a position where I'm running fundraisers but selling Extended Checkout I would definitely like to use an affiliate system to increase sales.

My plan is to make Extended Checkout the framework that the rest of the products rest on similar to how Unity Engine powers AAA video games.

...

Right now, I am working on Affiliate Manager by EC because I would like to use this plugin to sell Extended Checkout by EC.

Fundraiser is on the local level viz. people you know like a basketball team and affiliates are people far away who want to sell your products.

...

I am working on wp2mag and I need a theme for the site, so I'm going to create a release using [this CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_create).

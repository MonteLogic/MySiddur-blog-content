## Start: Sun May 11 2025 12:39:24 CDT

Attempting:
https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/61644

So, I'm going to build/run the app; of these platforms.

Android: App

Android: mWeb Chrome

iOS: App

iOS: mWeb Safari

iOS: mWeb Chrome

Windows: Chrome

MacOS: Chrome / Safari

MacOS: Desktop

The ones which I have the easiest access to is going to be Android app and Android mWeb Chrome.

....

I'm just going to use Chrome on my Linux and target the emulator in dev tools rather than using a virtual device as it's just WAY too slow.

But I will still use this for debugging the Android platform as well as testing purposes.

But I will do the bulk of my work on Chrome for Linux with the Android target.

Aside: What I would like to do is to get really good content generated from Gemini and I could read that in the down time.

...

Okay, so what I noticed is the one I was looking at ALREADY has proposals and some of them have like 3 or 4 of them and there are ones WITHOUT proposals so I'm going to get to working on THOSE.

So switching back to:
https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/60144


Also, I don't see any responses critiquing the proposals it looks like they post the proposal and they only get a response if it gets accepted.


The 60144 looks like it need admins rights but this looks more promising:

## Start: Wed May 14 2025 17:52:04 CDT

What I notice is that these issues get taken care of REALLY fast so its almost as if you need to get it done in the same sitting.

Okay, so my goal for today is to at least locally reproduce an issue in one sitting, then the next session get a pseudo working solution.


... 

I was able to reproduce the bug, it is basically making it so the notice for adding a category goes away. 


So apparently if you make a chat reply then the notice goes away all of a sudden...



## GtG: Gots to Go
Gots to go, but my ideal day would be a fix one of these Expensify issues then work on one of my SaaS projects for myself, either that be CBud or XCertified.io or MySiddur.io


## Start: Thu May 15 2025 16:18:59 CDT


I'm working on Device B, which is my other Thinkpad and I don't have the dev environment setup to run Expensify. 


The issue mentioned in the previous dev session:
https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/61960

The issue just mentioned it appears to be an internal issue. 

In my perusing I found this wonderful issue which describes a problem and its solution.
https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/59649

This issue showcases how the best proposals are accepted. 

I would like to compile a list of issues which perfectly demonstrate how good proposals are made. 

... 

Okay, what I think I'm going to do is, just make my own proposal, don't submit it, administer the changes and see if it passes the tests. 



### Back to SaaS stuff

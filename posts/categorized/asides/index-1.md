I feel like if you do what that Mormon dude (Kent C. Dodds) did as far as documenting the decisions you do and why you do them or why THEY did them would be a good piece of value to a repo.

Like, WHY did Expensify make a custom state manager, assumingly there wasn't a state manager on the market which could fill the stated roll but what if there is one today....

Another aside: I feel like there is an easier way to sync environments between two laptops without using a VM or having to worry about booting ISOs and all that, really just a command line.
